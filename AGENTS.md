# AGENTS.md

Canonical agent contract for VarLens. Any coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, OpenCode, Zed, Factory, …) should read this file before doing any work. `CLAUDE.md` imports this file and only adds Claude-specific notes on top.

Keep this file lean. If an instruction belongs to only one agent, put it in that agent's own file.

## Project Overview

VarLens is an Electron desktop app for **offline genetic variant analysis**. It imports annotated variant data (JSON or VCF), stores it in a local SQLite database, and provides filtering, cohort analysis, ACMG classification, HPO matching, and export. The app is distributed as signed installers for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux.

The target user is a clinical geneticist or researcher working with case-level variant data. **There is no backend service** — all data stays on the user's machine.

```

## Setup

```bash
npm ci                 # install deps; postinstall rebuilds native module for Electron
make dev               # rebuild for Electron + start electron-vite dev server
```

On Windows, `@electron/rebuild` requires **Visual Studio Build Tools** with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. GitHub Actions `windows-latest` has this pre-installed.

## Critical Gotcha: Native-Module Dual-Rebuild

`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` is a native Node.js addon that must be compiled against the **Node ABI of whoever is loading it**. Electron's Node ABI differs from system Node's. Tests run under system Node; the app runs under Electron. The rebuild has to match.

The canonical sequence:

```bash
npm ci                    # postinstall rebuilds for Electron
make rebuild-node         # rebuild for Node before running Vitest
make test                 # Vitest against Node-ABI binary
make rebuild              # rebuild for Electron before packaging or running the app
make dist                 # package
```

**If tests fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on `out/main/db-worker.js`** or native-load errors, the binary is built for the wrong ABI. Run `make rebuild-node` (for tests) or `make rebuild` (for the app) and retry.

Do **not** use `electron-builder install-app-deps` — it has been broken for Electron 20+. `postinstall` uses `@electron/rebuild` directly. `electron-builder`'s `npmRebuild: false` is intentional.

## Canonical Commands

The **Makefile is the source of truth**. GitHub Actions workflows mirror it target-for-target. When in doubt, run the `make` target, not the underlying npm script.

| Command                                                             | Purpose                                                                    |

| `make typecheck`                                                    | `vue-tsc` (renderer) + `tsc` (node) in parallel                            |
| `make test`                                                         | Vitest once (run `make rebuild-node` first)                                |
| `make test-watch` / `make test-coverage`                            | Vitest watch / with coverage                                               |
| `make build`                                                        | `electron-vite build` into `out/`                                          |
| `make dist` / `make dist-linux` / `make dist-mac` / `make dist-win` | Build + package                                                            |

**Before claiming work is done, run `make ci` at minimum.** If you have run local packaging first, clean `release/` before `make ci` because ESLint still traverses generated release artifacts. For anything touching Electron lifecycle, IPC, workers, or packaging, run `make ci-full`.

## Testing

- **Unit / integration**: Vitest. Files live next to source (e.g. `src/main/foo.ts` → `tests/main/foo.test.ts`). Happy-dom is the renderer environment. Run `make rebuild-node` first or the native module will ABI-fail.
- **E2E**: Playwright's native Electron support (`_electron.launch`) against the built `out/main/index.js`. See `tests/e2e/helpers/electron-app.ts` for the shared launcher (isolated `userData`, perf-mode hooks, failure capture). `make build` first.
- **Startup smoke**: `tests/e2e/startup-smoke.e2e.ts` asserts `app-ready`, `window-created`, `renderer-interactive` perf milestones. It is a first-class CI gate on Linux via `xvfb-run`. Treat failures as release blockers.
- **Perf**: `tests/e2e/renderer-perf-phase1.e2e.ts` + `scripts/perf/compare-phase1.mjs` produce reproducible frozen-fixture comparisons under `.planning/artifacts/perf/phase1/`. Any renderer-perf claim must come with a before/after comparison from this harness.
- **Preload contract**: `tests/shared/types/preload-contract.test.ts` locks the IPC surface to `IpcResult<T>` return types. If you touch IPC, this test is your first-line guardrail.
- **Coverage**: `COVERAGE=1 vitest run --coverage`. **Do not lower thresholds to make a failing suite pass** — add tests or fix the code.

## Code Style (non-obvious rules only)

A linter enforces formatting and generic TypeScript rules. What follows is what the linter cannot know.

- **Never use `console.log / console.error / console.warn` in application code.** Use the structured loggers:
  - Main process: `mainLogger` from `src/main/services/MainLogger` — `mainLogger.error(msg, 'source')`
  - Renderer: `logService` from `src/renderer/src/services/LogService` — `logService.error(msg, 'source')`
  - Documented exceptions: `logStore.ts` (bootstrap), `main.ts` (dev mode), `preload/index.ts` (no IPC yet), worker threads (no Electron IPC).
- **IPC channels use `domain:action` naming** — `cases:list`, `variants:query`, `filter-presets:save`. Handlers are registered in `src/main/ipc/handlers/<domain>.ts` and return through `wrapHandler(...)`, which produces `IpcResult<T | SerializableError>`. The renderer **must** call `unwrapIpcResult(...)` at the edge — see `src/renderer/src/utils/ipc-result.ts` and its broad use across the renderer.
- **IPC domains now follow the domain-module pattern by default**: `src/shared/ipc/domains/<name>.ts` (contract) + `src/preload/domains/<name>.ts` (preload binding) + `src/main/ipc/domains/<name>.ts` (handler registration). Most shipped app-facing domains are already on this shape. The remaining flat registrations are intentional (`shell`, `shortlist`, `system`, `updater`), so new work should follow the domain-module pattern rather than the old flat style.
- **Vue components** use `<script setup lang="ts">` with Composition API. Props via `defineProps<T>()`, emits via `defineEmits<{...}>()`. Prefer composables in `src/renderer/src/composables/` for shared logic — do **not** put shared logic in components.
- **Don't add try/catch for control flow in main-process IPC paths** — `wrapHandler` already converts thrown errors into `SerializableError` with structured fields. Let errors throw.

## UI / Vuetify Rules

Full pattern catalog in `.planning/docs/UI-PATTERNS.md`. The two that bite hardest:

- **Never use `surface-variant` for background colors.** VarLens's warm palette maps `surface-variant` to `#f5f2ef` against `surface` `#faf8f6` — white-on-white, invisible. Use `bg-grey-lighten-3` for subtle contrast (nested tables, expanded rows) or `secondary` `#424242` for strong contrast (tabs, toolbars).
- **`v-data-table-server` expand API**: `v-model:expanded` emits an **array of item keys (strings)**, not `{ value, item }` objects. Passing the wrong shape silently breaks row expansion.

## Domain Conventions

VarLens stores data from two very different input formats in **one unified schema**. Field naming follows a deliberate convention that is easy to get wrong:

- **`consequence`** → IMPACT level: `HIGH` | `MODERATE` | `LOW` | `MODIFIER`
- **`func`** → Sequence Ontology consequence term: `missense_variant`, `stop_gained`, `splice_acceptor_variant`, …

Both JSON-format imports and VCF imports (via VEP `CSQ` or SnpEff `ANN`) populate the same two fields with the same meaning. Don't swap them.

VCF import lives in `src/main/import/vcf/`. The pipeline is deliberately modular: `vcf-header-parser → vcf-line-parser → vcf-allele-splitter → vcf-annotation-parser → vcf-genotype-parser → VcfMapper → VcfStrategy`. `info-field-registry.ts` maps configured INFO fields to DB columns; everything else lands in the `info_json` column. Multi-sample VCFs create **one case per selected sample**.

Test data lives at `tests/test-data/vcf/` (GIAB Chinese Trio, chr22:29M–30.5M, annotated with VEP + SnpEff). Regenerate via `scripts/prepare-test-data.sh`.

## Planning & Documentation

- **All plans, specs, design docs, code reviews, and research notes go in `.planning/`.** Never put them in `docs/`.
- `.planning/specs/` for specifications, `.planning/plans/` for execution plans, `.planning/code-review/` for reviews, `.planning/artifacts/` for machine-generated artifacts (perf runs, inventories), `.planning/docs/` for long-form research notes that inform decisions.
- `docs/` is VitePress — **user-facing documentation only**. What ships on the website.

## Commit & PR Conventions

- **Conventional Commits.** Types used in this repo: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `ci`, `merge`. Optional scope in parentheses: `refactor(ipc): …`, `fix(renderer): …`. Read `git log --oneline -30` before opening a PR if you're unsure of current phrasing.
- **Release flow.** Versions are tagged `vX.Y.Z`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` **refuses to publish** if `build.yml` has not passed on the exact tagged SHA. Do not tag until CI is green on the commit you're tagging.
- **PRs.** Small, focused, green CI. If a change spans shell + IPC + database, split it unless the atomicity is load-bearing. Reference the `.planning/` plan or review that motivates the change.

## Workflow Maintenance

- **GitHub Actions must stay pinned to full commit SHAs, not floating tags.** Use the form `uses: owner/repo@<full-sha> # owner/repo@vX.Y.Z` so the reference is immutable and Dependabot can still update it cleanly.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` already tracks the `github-actions` ecosystem. When updating or adding workflow actions, keep the human-readable tag comment on the same `uses:` line so Dependabot preserves and refreshes it.

## Security Defaults

- Electron window creation enforces `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`. See `src/main/index.ts`. **Do not weaken these.**
- Renderer talks to main only through the typed `window.api` exposed by `src/preload/index.ts` — no raw `ipcRenderer`. Adding a new IPC channel means adding to the shared contract, preload, main handler, and (ideally) the preload contract test.
- External URLs are validated before `shell.openExternal`. Do not add a shortcut path that skips that validation.
- SQLite databases can be encrypted (`better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`). User keys are never logged; tests must not commit real user data.

## What NOT to do

- Do not introduce `console.*` calls.
- Do not widen IPC surface without adding types to `src/shared/ipc/domains/` (or `src/shared/types/api.ts` for legacy handlers).
- Do not import from a child of `src/renderer/src` into `src/main`. The renderer and main do not share a runtime; shared code goes through `src/shared/`.
- Do not lower coverage / lint / typecheck thresholds to make a failing suite pass. Add tests or fix the code.
- Do not put plans, specs, or reviews in `docs/`. Use `.planning/`.
- Do not commit `.planning/artifacts/perf/phase1/` run outputs — they are gitignored on purpose.
