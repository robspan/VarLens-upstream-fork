# Shortlist

The **Shortlist** tab is a ranked, cross-type view of the most interesting variants in a case. It combines SNV/indel, SV, CNV, and STR candidates into a single list ordered by a weighted clinical-relevance score, so you can triage the best candidates without jumping between per-type tabs.

![Shortlist tab in a case view, with three key regions highlighted](/screenshots/shortlist-overview.png)

1. **Shortlist tab** — a warm-primary accent bar marks it as categorically different from the raw per-type tabs that follow (SNV/Indel, SV, CNV, STR). Shown for every case that contains at least one variant type.
2. **Panel header** — **preset picker** on the left, **status line** in the middle (`Scored (capped): N → top M (elapsed ms)`), and a **Refresh** button on the right.
3. **Ranked row** — rank number, weighted **Score** (hover for a per-component breakdown), variant type chip, gene, coordinate + HGVS c./p. (SNV/indel), impact, allele frequency, ClinVar, star toggle, and a row-level actions menu.

## What it is for

The Shortlist exists for two complementary reasons:

1. **Cross-type comparison in a single view.** A loss-of-function SNV, a large deletion, and a pathologic STR expansion can now compete for attention under one ordering, which matches how clinicians actually triage multi-assay cases.
2. **Algorithmic ranking of best variants.** Even when a case has only one variant type (e.g. SNV-only research exomes), the ranked view saves you from manually configuring filters and sorts to surface top candidates.

## Built-in presets

Three presets ship with every database and drive different triage strategies. Switch between them from the **preset picker** in the panel header.

| Preset | Scope | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 candidates** | All 5 variant types | Strict: rare HIGH/MODERATE impact, top 50. ClinVar P/LP and starred variants are pinned to the top regardless of their raw score. |
| **All rare damaging** | All 5 variant types | Broad: any rare HIGH/MODERATE variant, top 200. Score-driven ordering with no pins. |
| **Recessive candidates** | SNV/indel only | Narrower: rare HIGH/MOD SNVs with impact + pathogenicity + rarity + ClinVar weighting. Good starting point for recessive disease cases. |

Each preset defines:
- A **filter set** applied to all variant types before ranking.
- A **per-type override** that loosens filters where needed (e.g. SV/CNV get a 1% allele-frequency ceiling instead of the 0.1% used for SNVs because no gnomAD-SV source is wired).
- A **weight vector** for the five score components (impact, pathogenicity, rarity, ClinVar, phenotype).
- Optional **pin rules** (`clinvarPinTop`, `pinStarredTop`) and **tie-breakers** applied after the primary rank sort.

The full heuristic, every numeric threshold, and every rationale is documented in the [Shortlist scoring heuristic reference](https://github.com/berntpopp/VarLens/blob/main/.planning/docs/shortlist-scoring-heuristic.md) (developer doc — useful if you want to understand exactly how a score is computed).

## How rows are ordered

After Stage 1 fetches candidate rows from the database and Stage 2 computes a weighted score per row, the final sort applies a **5-level partition**:

1. **Starred-pinned** first — when `pinStarredTop` is on and you've starred the row.
2. **ClinVar-pinned** next — when `clinvarPinTop` is on and the row's ClinVar significance is ≥ Likely pathogenic.
3. **`rank_score` DESC** — the primary weighted sort.
4. **Caller-supplied tie-breakers** — up to 10 sort directives (e.g. CADD DESC, then gene name ASC).
5. **`id` ASC** — stable deterministic fallback.

Starred variants override ClinVar-pinned ones, so a star is the strongest curation signal you can apply.

## Score breakdown on hover

Hover any row's **Score** badge to see the weighted breakdown: the five components (impact, pathogenicity, rarity, ClinVar, phenotype) with their raw sub-scores in [0, 1], alongside any active pin flag (Starred or ClinVar P/LP). This makes the ranking transparent — you can always see *why* a row is near the top.

## Auto-refresh on annotation

When you star, comment on, or ACMG-classify any variant in the current case (from any tab — SNV, SV, CNV, STR, or Shortlist itself), the Shortlist automatically re-fetches within one IPC round-trip. You never need to click **Refresh** manually. This is driven by an internal `variants:annotationChanged` broadcast the main process emits on every successful annotation write.

## Row actions

Each row supports:

- **Click the row** → opens **Variant Details** in the side panel, same as the per-type tables. Structural-variant, CNV, and STR rows all route through the same drill-down path thanks to a shared row contract.
- **Star icon** → toggles the star. Writes through `annotations:upsertPerCase`; the broadcast refresh handles the rest.
- **⋮ (kebab)** menu → **View details** (same as row click) and **View in \<type\> tab** — the latter switches to the corresponding per-type tab where you keep the full per-type VariantTable context.

## Pagination and scrolling

The Shortlist table paginates at **50 rows per page** by default. You can switch to 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 via the per-page selector at the bottom. For large result sets the **table body scrolls independently** of the footer so pagination controls are always in view.

## Choosing your default active tab

Which tab opens first when you navigate into a case is a **per-user preference**. The default is **Shortlist**, but if you prefer to start from the raw per-type table you can flip it:

![Application Preferences dialog with the Case View section highlighted](/screenshots/shortlist-settings.png)

1. **Default active tab** dropdown under **Case View** in the preferences dialog. Choose:
   - `Shortlist (ranked view)` — default; land on the ranked view every time.
   - `SNV/Indel (per-type table)` — land on the first present per-type tab (SNV/indel, or whichever type the case has).

### Where to find the setting

1. Click the **gear icon** ⚙ in the top-right corner of the VarLens app bar.
2. Select **Application Preferences**.
3. Scroll to the **Case View** section.
4. Change **Default active tab** to your preference.
5. The change is saved automatically and takes effect the next time you open any case.

The Shortlist tab itself is always shown when a case has at least one variant type — this preference only controls which tab is **default-active**, not whether the tab exists. Switching to Shortlist from a per-type tab is still a single click away.

## When the Shortlist tab does NOT appear

Only one case in the whole UI where the tab is hidden: an **empty case** with zero variants of any type. Every case with at least one SNV, indel, SV, CNV, or STR gets a Shortlist tab.

## Known limitations

These are documented as Phase-1 gaps and tracked for future releases:

- **No population frequency for SVs, CNVs, or STRs.** There's no gnomAD-SV equivalent wired into VarLens yet, so the rarity component for those types is a placeholder `1.0` (full credit). SNV rarity via gnomAD works as expected.
- **Inheritance-mode filtering is not forwarded to the Shortlist Stage-1 query.** The "Recessive candidates" preset uses HIGH/MOD consequence + rarity filters to approximate the intent. A future release will forward `inheritanceModes` once the shared filter builder supports it on the Shortlist path.
- **Phenotype similarity is disabled by default.** All three built-in presets set the `phenotype` weight to 0 because VarLens doesn't ship with an HPO similarity pipeline. The formula slot is ready for phenotype scoring — only a preset weight change is needed once the source lands.
