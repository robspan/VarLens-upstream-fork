/**
 * Vitest config — split by test environment via Projects so:
 *
 *   - `tests/main/**` and `tests/shared/**` (121 + 11 files) run under the
 *     Node environment. They exercise main-process code + better-sqlite3
 *     and never touch DOM APIs, so paying the happy-dom tax on every file
 *     was pure waste (the single biggest cost in the previous single-env
 *     config, per 2026-04-10 benchmarks and the Vitest perf guide).
 *
 *   - `tests/renderer/**` (61 files) stays on happy-dom. Roughly half of
 *     these mount Vue components via `@vue/test-utils` and genuinely
 *     need the DOM; the rest pay a small fixed cost that isn't worth
 *     the complexity of per-file env switching.
 *
 * File parallelism is re-enabled. The previous `fileParallelism: false`
 * setting — a workaround for https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/8968
 * ("timeout terminating forks worker" with better-sqlite3) — was the
 * dominant slowdown, forcing 193 files through a single worker. The
 * project split isolates Vue/happy-dom workers from better-sqlite3
 * workers, which addresses the underlying worker-termination race
 * without serializing everything.
 *
 * We keep `pool: 'forks'` (not `threads`) because better-sqlite3-multiple-
 * ciphers is a native C++ addon and Vitest's `threads` pool documents
 * segfault risk for native modules.
 *
 * Coverage is gated on `COVERAGE=1` so PR runs can skip the collection
 * and reporting overhead and only the main-branch CI job (and the
 * explicit `npm run test:coverage`) pays the cost.
