/**
 * Single source of truth for every tunable constant used by the Shortlist
 * scoring heuristic. Every magic number that used to be inlined across
 * `score-snv.ts`, `score-sv.ts`, `score-cnv.ts`, `score-str.ts`, and the
 * shared `index.ts` mappings now lives here.
 *
 * Why a standalone config module:
 *
 *   • A single `grep` finds every knob.
 *   • A tuning PR touches one file, not five.
 *   • Tests can import the same constants to avoid drift between test
 *     fixtures and production code.
 *   • Rationale comments stay attached to the constant they justify.
 *
 * Structure:
 *
 *   SCORING_CONFIG
 *     ├── consequenceImpact     — VEP IMPACT → impact sub-score
 *     ├── clinvarBoost          — ClinVar significance → clinvar sub-score
 *     ├── snv                   — SNV / indel thresholds + curve params
