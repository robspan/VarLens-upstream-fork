VarLens is a cross-platform desktop application for offline genetic variant analysis. It provides a data-dense interface for importing, filtering, annotating, and exporting variant data -- all processed locally, with no data leaving your machine.

**[Documentation](https://berntpopp.github.io/VarLens/)** | **[Download](https://github.com/berntpopp/VarLens/releases/latest)**

## Features

- **Import** annotated variant data from JSON files (single, batch, or ZIP)
- **Filter** by gene, consequence, population frequency, pathogenicity scores, and more
- **Annotate** variants with stars, comments, tags, and ACMG classifications
- **Classify** with ACMG criteria and auto-suggested evidence
- **Analyze cohorts** with carrier aggregation and gene burden testing
- **Match phenotypes** using HPO-based similarity scoring
- **Export** filtered results to Excel or CSV
- **Store** data locally in SQLite with optional encryption
